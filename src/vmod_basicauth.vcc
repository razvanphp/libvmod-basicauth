$Module basicauth 3 Basic HTTP authentication

COLOPHON
========
This document provides a short description of the **vmod-basicauth** module.
For a detailed documentation, please see the vmod-basicauth(3) manual page.

DESCRIPTION
===========
The **vmod-basicauth** module implements basic HTTP authentication against
the password file created using the **htpasswd** command.

Four kinds of password  hashes  are  supported:  Apache MD5, crypt, SHA1,
and plaintext.

$Function BOOL match(PRIV_TASK, STRING, STRING)

Description
    The **match** function returns **TRUE** or **FALSE** depending on whether
    the authentication succeeds or not.  The *passfile* argument supplies the
    name of the password file to use.  The *authstr* argument is the
    authentication string (normally, the value of the Authorization HTTP
    header).

Example
    ::

      if (!basicauth.match("/var/www/.htpasswd", req.http.Authorization)) {
           return(synth(401, "Restricted"));
      }
