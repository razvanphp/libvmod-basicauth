* Overview

This module implements basic HTTP authentication against the password file
created with the htpasswd(1) utility.  The following password hashes are
supported: Apache MD5, crypt(3), SHA1, and plaintext.

* Example

import basicauth;

sub vcl_recv {
	if (!basicauth.match("/var/www/.htpasswd",
		             req.http.Authorization)) {
		error 401 "Authentication required";
	}
}	

* Installation

In order to compile the package you need to have Varnish source tree.
At least Varnish 3.0.1 is required.  Supposing that the varnish source tree
is available under /usr/src/varnish-3.0.1, run:

  ./configure --with-varnish-source=/usr/src/varnish-3.0.1

Once configured, do
  
  make

This will build the module.  After this step you can optionally run
'make test' to test the package.

Finally, do the following command as root:
  
  make install

* Documentation

The manual page vmod_basicauth(3) will be available after successful
install.  To read it without installing the module, run
'man src/vmod_basicauth.3'.
